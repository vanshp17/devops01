# Glossary - The Art of Conscious Living

Welcome to the "Glossary" React application. This is a frontend e-commerce experience designed to showcase artisan goods with a focus on sustainability and craftsmanship.

## About The Project

This project is a React application built to serve as the online storefront for "Glossary." It features a curated collection of handcrafted goods, allowing users to browse products, learn about the artisans, manage a shopping cart, and complete a simulated checkout process.

The entire application is self-contained. All product data is stored locally in `src/data/products.js`, and no external backend or database is required.

### Built With

* **React.js**: For building the user interface.
* **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing.
* **Redux Toolkit**: For robust and predictable state management.
* **Styled Components**: For component-scoped styling and theming.
